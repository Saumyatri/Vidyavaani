<h1 class="inspire">WHY IS VIDYAVAANI IMPORTANT?</h1>
<p>
Vidyavaani was created because of its relevance with regard to Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education. In this website, we have created a variety of Data Visuals to depict how critical the situation is. Globally, <b>244 million</b> youth, are not in education, employment or training, according to UNESCO 2022. Girl Up says that 50% of girls drop out before they reach class 7.
  <br><br>
  There are several reasons why children are not sent to school or why they drop out. Some of the reasons are as follows:
<br>
  1. Child Labour: Underprivileged youth start working early to afford meals, clothing and even housing. This is usually because of overpopulated housing (One family has more than 2-3 children).
  <br>
  2. Child Marriage: It has been noted that girls usually stop studying early so that they can be 'married' and start their family, as they have been raised.
  <br>
  3. Conflict/War: Similar to the situation in Afghanistan and Syria, there are countries where children cannot be sent to school because of the fighting around them.
  <br>
  4. The COVID pandemic caused the learning medium to shift online. For a major part of the population, the focus was on their own health. There was also a lot of misinformation. Those who could not afford digital devices could not study and hence, the digital divide increased the educational gap.
<br><br>  
If you would like to support our goal of ensuring that youth across the world are educated, we encourage you to speak to people around you to increase awareness about the lack of education and consider how you can work towards narrowing the gap between the privileged and the underprivileged.
