      <h1><b> OUR MISSION</b></h1>
      <p class="mission">Vidyavaani is a compounded name of two hindi words ‘Vidya’ and ‘Vaani’ that translates to
        Intelligence and Voice respectively. Together, it stands for ‘The Voice of Knowledge’. With this name we tried
        to give a voice to the voiceless who try to seek an education all while enduring the pain of poverty, apathy and
        hunger.
        <br><br>
        The reason for our focus on education is, simply put, the same reason for why we consider the pen to be more
        powerful than the sword. This is because the pen, like an education, molds perspectives and influences mindsets.
        Education is the tool that gives us opportunity. We aim, through this project, to follow through with
        Sustainable Development Goal 4, and make Quality Education a right not a privilege across Asia.
